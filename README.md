# W2P3-JavaScript

Write a JavaScript program to print out the first n numbers in the Fibonacci series. The program will ask the user how many numbers they want (n). The Fibonacci series is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, .... (Note that the series starts with 0, 1, and thereafter every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.)
